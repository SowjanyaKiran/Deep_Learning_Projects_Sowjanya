# Deep_Learning_Projects_Sowjanya

This repository showcases my deep learning mini-projects and assignments using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, and GRU. These models were implemented using TensorFlow/Keras in Google Colab and focus on real-world datasets such as credit card fraud detection, diabetes diagnosis, and breast cancer classification.
